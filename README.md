# Student-MVC

This program make the simple things: "add student","remove student" and "modifies record about student" 

shortcomings:
Id in this program, generated with its own class,
so that everything worked, in mongodb you need to create a schem student and in it to create two collections,
of info and sequences in the collection sequences you need to add a record
db.sequences.insert ({"" _ id: " info "," sequences ": 0})
it is necessary for generation id and on it there is a removal and change of records.

in the near future everything will be fixed.
